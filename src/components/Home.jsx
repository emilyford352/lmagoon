                Did you know that a large portion of your beliefs today were formulated before the age of 7? Did you
                know that most of the way you feel about yourself and others could have been programmed by the
                people who influenced you while you were a child? It is now time to take matters into your own hands,
                learn to design your own thought patterns and unlock your key to Self-empowerment.
